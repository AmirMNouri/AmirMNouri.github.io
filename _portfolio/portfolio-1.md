Vector Flow Imaging (VFI) using speckle tracking in ultrasound is a cutting-edge technique for visualizing and quantifying blood flow dynamics within vessels and cardiac chambers. Unlike traditional Doppler methods, which measure flow only along the ultrasound beam, VFI provides a full 2D or even 3D vector representation of flow, capturing both magnitude and direction. Speckle tracking enables this by identifying and following unique patterns of speckles generated by ultrasound echoes as they move with the blood flow. This method is particularly effective in complex flow scenarios, such as bifurcations or vortex formations, offering high spatial and temporal resolution. VFI has significant clinical applications, including improved hemodynamic assessment in vascular and cardiac diagnostics, as it provides a deeper understanding of flow patterns and shear stress, critical for evaluating cardiovascular health.
